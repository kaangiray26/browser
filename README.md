Serve web pages directly from your browser

## About
This is a P2P web server, which allows you to serve web applications from your browser. That means you can even use your phone as a server. With this solution, you are not just limited to static web pages, but you can also build dynamic pages by configuring routes, handling requests, taking URL parameters, and more.

Please follow the project page for more information:
